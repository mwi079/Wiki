**If I'd had more time**

- I would add in the requested feature to search for a revision of a document by the timestamp for which it was the latest revision. This isn't difficult, I just ran out of time.

- The error handling would be more verbose. All you get on the FE at the moment is the understanding that something has gone wrong.

- There would be higher test coverage. I wrote tests for one component as an example. 

- The styling would be less shit.

**Comments**

- I had to make some minor changed to the BE to get the API to run properly. From my minimal google research I believe it's because i'm running python 3 rather than python 2. Might be worth looking into this for future candidates.
